1. Waste Categories
South Korea’s waste system is strictly segregated into several key categories:
  1. General Waste (일반 쓰레기) – non-recyclable items consists of everyday household items such as tissue paper, receipts, diapers, sanitary products, certain types of mixed-material packaging, and other non-recyclable materials.
  2. Recyclables (재활용품) – paper, metal, glass, plastics, plastic bags (vinyl), and cans 
  3. Food Waste (음식물 쓰레기) – organic, compostable scraps
  4. Special Household Waste (특수 쓰레기) – broken ceramics, PVC, small electronics, batteries, light bulbs, and hazardous materials
  5. Large‑Item Waste (대형 폐기물) – bulky items like furniture, appliances, mattresses, etc
  6. Clothes (의류) - Old clothes, curtains, shoes, and bags can be thrown out in the clothing bins (의류 수거함) located in your residential area.

2. Official Waste Bags & Fees
  - Volume-Based Fee System (종량제): All non‑recyclables must go in official district-issued bags (종량제 봉투). You can buy these in convenience stores or supermarkets (sizes vary: 5L, 10L, 20L, 50L, 100L).
  - Food Waste Bags: RFID‑tagged bags for organic waste; charges vary by district based on weight.
  - Special Waste & Large Items: Use special-issue bags or attach prepaid stickers (stamp notes) from your local gu office.

3. Preparation & Sorting
Before disposal, ensure items are:
  - Cleaned & dried
  - Materials separated, especially for mixed items (e.g., remove lids, labels)
  - Paper flattened and bundled
  - Bottles rinsed and crushed
  - Do not include food residues in recyclables

4. Disposal Schedules & Locations
  - General waste: Place tied bags at designated curbside spots near your home. Disposal times may vary by district—check local notices.
  - Recyclables & food waste: Disposal times may vary by district—check local notices.
  - Large items: Arrange pickup via your gu office, using the stamped sticker system.
  - It is important to check the relevant disposal times before disposing of garbage.

5. Special Waste & E‑Waste
  - Hazardous small items: Batteries, fluorescent lamps, medicine, etc., must go to designated collection points or hazard‑waste bins.
  - Electronic Waste: Follow EPR rules—these items are collected via municipal or manufacturer arrangements.

6. Fines & Regulations
  - Non-compliance (like using wrong bag, mixing waste, improper timing/place) may incur fines up to ₩100,000–₩1,000,000.

7. Why It Matters
  - Korea dramatically cut landfill trash from ~81% in 1994 to under 10% by 2013 .
  - Food waste is recycled into compost or animal feed—landfill disposal banned since 2005 .
  - Strong recycling infrastructure supports a high circular-economy model, with ambitious 70%+ plastic recycling goals by 2030 .
